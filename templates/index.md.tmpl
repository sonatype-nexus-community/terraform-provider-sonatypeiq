# Sonatype IQ Provider

The `sonatypeiq` provider is used to interact with resources supported by [Sonatype IQ Server](https://help.sonatype.com/en/sonatype-iq-server.html). 

The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

When using the provider the username/password need to have the correct role/permissions assigned to them for the resources you intend to consume or manage.

[User management](https://help.sonatype.com/en/user-management.html) instruction can be found in the official
documentation. Creating roles is also documented [here](https://help.sonatype.com/en/role-management.html) and how to
generate the username/tokens for a user can be found [here](https://help.sonatype.com/en/iq-server-user-tokens.html)

## Compatability

This Provider is tested against Sonatype IQ Server versions `186` through `196` currently.
	
Some resources and features may depend on the version of Sonatype IQ Server you are running. See individual Data Source and Resource documentaiton for details.
