# sonatypeiq Provider

When using the provider the username/password need to have the correct role/permissions assigned to them for the
resources you intend to consume or manages.

[User management](https://help.sonatype.com/en/user-management.html) instruction can be found in the official
documentation. Creating roles is also documented [here](https://help.sonatype.com/en/role-management.html) and how to
generate the username/tokens for a user can be found [here](https://help.sonatype.com/en/iq-server-user-tokens.html)
